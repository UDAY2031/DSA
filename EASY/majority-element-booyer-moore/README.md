# Majority Element (Boyer-Moore Algorithm)

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the **Boyer–Moore Majority Vote Algorithm**.

The algorithm finds the majority element in an array, i.e., an element that appears more than `n/2` times (if it exists).

---

## 📘 Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return the majority element.  
If no such element exists, return `-1`.

## 🚀 Algorithm Used
- **Boyer–Moore Majority Vote Algorithm**
- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
